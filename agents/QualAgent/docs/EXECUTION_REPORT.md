│              Core QualAgent Infrastructure                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Principles:**
- **Modular Architecture**: Each enhancement is a separate, testable component
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved while adding new features
- **Extensibility**: Framework designed for easy addition of new models and features
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive data validation and error handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Concurrent execution and intelligent resource management

### **2. Multi-LLM Analysis Methodology**

**Parallel Model Execution:**
- **5 LLM Models**: mixtral-8x7b, llama-3-70b, qwen2-72b, gemma-2-27b, Llama-3.2-11B
- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable parallelism (default: 3 concurrent models)
- **Quality Assessment**: Automatic evaluation of each model's analysis quality
- **Consensus Generation**: Weighted averaging based on model confidence and historical performance

**Model Selection Logic:**
```python
def determine_best_model(individual_scores, llm_results):
    quality_metrics = {
        'completeness': weight * 0.3,      # Presence of expected analysis sections
        'confidence': weight * 0.4,        # Average confidence across scores
        'justification_quality': weight * 0.2,  # Quality of reasoning
        'source_citation': weight * 0.1    # Presence of sources
    }
    return highest_scoring_model
```

### **3. Comprehensive Scoring Framework**
