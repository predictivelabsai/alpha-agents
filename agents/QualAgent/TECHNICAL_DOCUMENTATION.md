## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overall Design Philosophy

QualAgent employs a modular, service-oriented architecture that decouples core functionalities to enable flexible configuration and extension. The system is designed around six primary components: Data Management, LLM Integration, Tools Integration, Prompt Adaptation, Analysis Orchestration, and Result Processing. This separation of concerns allows for independent evolution of each component while maintaining system coherence.

### 2.2 Core Components

#### 2.2.1 JSON Data Management Layer

The data management layer implements a comprehensive JSON-based storage system optimized for both transactional integrity and analytical querying. The system uses four primary JSON files:

**companies.json**: Stores fundamental company information including ticker symbols, subsector classification, market capitalization, and descriptive metadata.

**analysis_requests.json**: Tracks analysis configurations, request parameters, execution status, and processing metrics.

**llm_analyses.json**: Stores individual model outputs, token usage, cost information, processing metadata, and parsed results.

**structured_results.json**: Contains processed analysis data organized for efficient querying and frontend presentation.

The JSON storage design provides several advantages:
- **Deployment Simplicity**: No database server required, simplifying deployment
- **Version Control**: Easy to track changes and backup
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across all operating systems
- **Easy Export**: Direct compatibility with pandas and other analytical tools

```python
@dataclass
class Company:
    company_name: str
    ticker: str
    subsector: str
    market_cap_usd: Optional[float] = None
    employees: Optional[int] = None
    founded_year: Optional[int] = None
    headquarters: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None
    website: Optional[str] = None
    status: str = 'active'
    id: Optional[str] = None
    created_at: Optional[str] = None
    updated_at: Optional[str] = None
```

#### 2.2.2 LLM Integration Engine

The LLM Integration Engine provides a unified interface across multiple LLM providers, currently supporting TogetherAI and OpenAI APIs with extensible architecture for additional providers.

**Provider Abstraction**: A standardized interface that normalizes API differences across providers, enabling seamless model switching and multi-provider analysis workflows.

```python
class LLMIntegration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'llama-3-70b': {'provider': 'together', 'cost_per_1k': 0.0009},
            'mixtral-8x7b': {'provider': 'together', 'cost_per_1k': 0.0006},
            'qwen2-72b': {'provider': 'together', 'cost_per_1k': 0.0009},
            'gpt-4o': {'provider': 'openai', 'cost_per_1k': 0.005},
            'gpt-4o-mini': {'provider': 'openai', 'cost_per_1k': 0.00015}
        }
```

**Cost Management**: Real-time cost tracking and estimation capabilities, including per-token pricing models and batch analysis cost projections.

**Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry mechanisms and comprehensive error categorization to handle API rate limits, transient failures, and model-specific constraints.

#### 2.2.3 Tools Integration Framework

The Tools Integration Framework provides access to external research APIs to enhance analysis quality:

**Tavily Integration**: Real-time web search and information retrieval for current market conditions and competitive intelligence.

**Polygon Integration**: Financial market data including stock prices, trading volumes, and fundamental financial metrics.

**Exa Integration**: Advanced semantic search capabilities for finding relevant research papers, analyst reports, and technical documentation.

```python
class ToolsIntegration:
    def _load_tool_configurations(self) -> Dict[str, ToolConfig]:
        tools = {}

        # Tavily for real-time web search
        if os.getenv('TAVILY_API_KEY'):
            tools['Tavily'] = ToolConfig(
                name='Tavily',
                api_key=os.getenv('TAVILY_API_KEY'),
                base_url='https://api.tavily.com/search',
                description='Real-time web search and information retrieval'
            )

        return tools
```

#### 2.2.4 Prompt Adaptation Framework

The Prompt Adaptation Framework addresses the challenge of optimizing prompts for different model families while maintaining analytical consistency. The framework implements model-family-specific adaptations:

**Llama Family Adaptations**: Optimized for detailed reasoning with explicit step-by-step instructions and structured output formatting.

**Mixtral Family Adaptations**: Leveraged for balanced analysis with emphasis on multi-perspective reasoning and contradiction identification.

**Qwen Family Adaptations**: Tailored for comprehensive analytical depth with enhanced source citation and evidence structuring.

**GPT Family Adaptations**: Configured for high-quality analytical output with emphasis on synthesis and insight generation.

```python
class PromptAdapter:
    def create_adapted_prompt(self, model_name: str, company_data: Dict,
                            analysis_config: Dict) -> str:
        adaptation = self._get_model_adaptation(model_name)

        # Base prompt with tools integration
        base_prompt = self.base_prompt['instructions']
        tools_section = self.tools_integration.generate_tool_prompt_section()

        # Model-specific adaptations
        if adaptation.reasoning_style == "step_by_step":
            base_prompt += "\n\nPlease work through your analysis step by step."
        elif adaptation.reasoning_style == "multi_perspective":
            base_prompt += "\n\nConsider multiple perspectives and identify any contradictions."

        return base_prompt
```

#### 2.2.5 Analysis Orchestration Engine

The Analysis Orchestration Engine manages the complete analytical workflow from request initiation to result storage:

**Multi-Model Execution**: Parallel execution of analyses across multiple models with configurable model selection and fallback strategies.

**Consensus Generation**: Implementation of analytical consensus algorithms that synthesize multi-model outputs while identifying and resolving contradictions.

**Quality Assurance**: Automated validation of analysis completeness, source quality assessment, and consistency checking across model outputs.

```python
async def analyze_company(self, ticker: str, models: List[str],
                         focus_themes: List[str]) -> AnalysisResult:
    # Create analysis request
    request_id = self.db.create_analysis_request(...)

    # Execute multi-model analysis
    llm_analyses = []
    for model in models:
        analysis = await self._execute_single_analysis(model, ticker, focus_themes)
        llm_analyses.append(analysis)

    # Generate consensus if multiple models
    if len(models) > 1:
        consensus = self._generate_consensus_analysis(llm_analyses)

    return AnalysisResult(analyses=llm_analyses, consensus=consensus)
```

#### 2.2.6 Result Processing and Validation

The Result Processing component implements comprehensive parsing and validation of LLM outputs:

**JSON Schema Validation**: Strict adherence to predefined analytical schema with comprehensive error reporting and recovery mechanisms.

**Content Quality Assessment**: Automated evaluation of response completeness, relevance, and analytical depth.

**Structured Data Extraction**: Parsing of complex analytical outputs into structured formats suitable for database storage and downstream analysis.
