    This implementation is based on the **Alpha Agents** research paper, which demonstrated the effectiveness 
    of multi-agent systems in financial decision-making through collaborative analysis, structured debate, 
    and consensus-building mechanisms.
    
    **Key Research Insights:**
    - Multi-agent systems outperform single-agent approaches in complex financial analysis
    - Structured debate mechanisms improve decision quality and reduce bias
    - Specialized agents with domain expertise provide more accurate assessments
    - Consensus-building through collaboration leads to better portfolio construction
